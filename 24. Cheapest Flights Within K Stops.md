## 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1  
Output: 700  
Explanation:  
The graph is shown above.  
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.  
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.  
Example 2:  


Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1   
Output: 200  
Explanation:  
The graph is shown above.  
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.  
Example 3:  


Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0  
Output: 500  
Explanation:  
The graph is shown above.  
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.  
 

Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 100  
0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)  
flights[i].length == 3  
0 <= fromi, toi < n  
fromi != toi  
1 <= pricei <= 104    
There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.  
0 <= src, dst, k < n  
src != dst  

## Approach- 
In this question, the only cache is - the number of stops we can  take from source city to reach destination city.
So, use dijiksta algorith with using comparator on stops.  
Note -- since we count stops at each node starting from 0. suppose 0-->1-->2-->3 in this sequence , till 3, we have taken only two stop but we got 3. It means if at any city we have k step then we can take one more stop
