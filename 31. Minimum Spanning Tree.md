## Minimum Spanning Tree

Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph with V vertices and E edges, your task is to find the sum of the weights of the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph. The graph is represented by an adjacency list, where each element adj[i] is a vector containing vector of integers. Each vector represents an edge, with the first integer denoting the endpoint of the edge and the second integer denoting the weight of the edge.

Input:  
3 3  
0 1 5  
1 2 3  
0 2 1  
Output: 4  
Explanation:
The Spanning Tree resulting in a weight of 4 is shown above.    

Input:   
2 1  
0 1 5  
Output: 5   
Explanation: Only one Spanning Tree is possible which has a weight of 5.  

Constraints:  
2 ≤ V ≤ 1000  
V-1 ≤ E ≤ (V*(V-1))/2  
1 ≤ w ≤ 1000  
The graph is connected and doesn't contain self-loops & multiple edges.  

## Approach - 
In prims algorithm, we find a spanning tree whose sum of edge weight is minimum. We will use priority queue which will maintain order in increasing order of edge weight.
We will start from 0th node with 0 weight.
if that node is already  visited then continue 
else add the weight to the ans and mark that node as visited.  
find all its adjacent node - if not visited then add it to the queue with the corresponding edge weight

```

class Solution {
    static class Pair{
        int distance, nod;
        Pair(int d, int n){
            distance=d; nod=n;
        }
    }
    static int spanningTree(int V, int E, List<List<int[]>> adj) {
        // Code Here.
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->a.distance-b.distance);
        boolean vis[]=new boolean[V];
        pq.add(new Pair(0,0));
        int sum=0;
        while(!pq.isEmpty()){
            Pair pair=pq.remove();
            int dist = pair.distance;
            int node=pair.nod;
            if(vis[node]){ continue; }
            vis[node]=true;
            sum+=dist;
            for(int nums[] : adj.get(node)){
                int adjNode=nums[0];
                int wt=nums[1];
                if(!vis[adjNode]){
                    pq.add(new Pair(wt,adjNode));
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
