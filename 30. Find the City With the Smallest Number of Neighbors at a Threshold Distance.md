## 1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.   
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:  
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]   
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]   
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]   
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]   
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.  

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2  
Output: 0   
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.   
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:  
City 0 -> [City 1]   
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4]   
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4]   
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]  
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3]   
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.  
 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100  
1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2  
edges[i].length == 3   
0 <= fromi < toi < n   
1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4  
All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.  

## Approach-
We have to find the city from which we can go to minimum number of other city within threshold distance. 
So, First we will find the shortest distance between from each city to each city using floyd warshal algorithm.
After that , we will find the the number of city reached from each city and will return the city from which minimum number of city is reached.

```
class Solution {
    public int findTheCity(int n, int[][] edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        // making matrix to find the shortest distance between each city
        int nums[][]=new int[n][n];
        for(int r[] : nums){
            Arrays.fill(r,(int)(1e9));
        }
        for(int arr[] : edges){
            int u=arr[0], v=arr[1], wt=arr[2];
            nums[u][v]=wt;
            nums[v][u]=wt;
        }
        // diagonal element i.e. same 
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            nums[i][i]=0;
        }
        // applying floyd warshal algorithm
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                for(int k=0; k<n; k++){
                    nums[j][k]=Math.min(nums[j][k], nums[j][i]+nums[i][k]);
                }
            }
        }
        int city=-1; // to track the city fom which minimum number of city is reached within threshold
        int reachable=n+1; // number of city reached from "city"
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int c=0;
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                if(nums[i][j] <= distanceThreshold){ c++; }
            }
            if(c<reachable){
                reachable=c;
                city=i;
            }else if(c==reachable){
                city=i;
            }
        }
        return city;
    }
}
