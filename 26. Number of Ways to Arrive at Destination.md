## 1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination

You are in a city that consists of n intersections numbered from 0 to n - 1 with bi-directional roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei] means that there is a road between intersections ui and vi that takes timei minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1 in the shortest amount of time.

Return the number of ways you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:  


Input: n = 7, roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.  
The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:  
- 0 ➝ 6  
- 0 ➝ 4 ➝ 6  
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 2 ➝ 5 ➝ 6  
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 3 ➝ 5 ➝ 6  
Example 2:  

Input: n = 2, roads = [[1,0,10]]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.  
 

Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 200  
n - 1 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2  
roads[i].length == 3  
0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1  
1 <= timei <= 109  
ui != vi  
There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.  
You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.  

## Approach - 
Since we have to reach from from 0th node to the (n-1)th node using shortest distance, so we can think about dijikstra algorithm.  
In the given constraints, distance (i.e. time) can very large , so we will use long type datatype to avoid overflow.  
Lets assume initial distance is very high because we are looking for shortest distance. 
distance of 0th node is 0 and ways to reach 0th node is 1 i.e. directly .
Since we are looking for a shortest distance so use priority queue which is sorted in term of min distance.
Now, suppose we have reached a node in n ways and now again we have reached same node in m ways having shorter distance 
 in this case, we have to update the number of ways to reach there.
Suppose we have reached the same node with another path having same distance, then the ways to reach there get double. Here take mod to avoid averflow.

```
class Solution {
    class Pair {
        int node;
        long distance;
        Pair(int n, long d) {
            node = n;
            distance = d;
        }
    }

    public int countPaths(int n, int[][] roads) {
        List<List<Pair>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        // Build adjacency list
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            int u = road[0], v = road[1], cost = road[2];
            adj.get(u).add(new Pair(v, cost));
            adj.get(v).add(new Pair(u, cost));
        }

        // Min-heap (Priority Queue) for Dijkstra
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->Long.compare(a.distance,b.distance));
        long[] dist = new long[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Long.MAX_VALUE);
        int[] ways = new int[n];
        int mod = 1_000_000_007;

        // Initialize start node
        dist[0] = 0;
        ways[0] = 1;
        pq.add(new Pair(0, 0));

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Pair current = pq.poll();
            int node = current.node;
            long curDist = current.distance;

            for (Pair neighbor : adj.get(node)) {
                int adjNode = neighbor.node;
                long cost = neighbor.distance;
                long newDist = cost+curDist;
                // Found a shorter path
                if (newDist < dist[adjNode]) {
                    dist[adjNode] = newDist;
                    ways[adjNode] = ways[node];
                    pq.add(new Pair(adjNode, newDist));
                }
                // Found an equal shortest path
                else if (newDist == dist[adjNode]) {
                    ways[adjNode] = (ways[adjNode] + ways[node]) % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        return ways[n - 1];
    }
}
