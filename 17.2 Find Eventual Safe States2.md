## 802. Find Eventual Safe States (using Topologocal sort)

There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].
A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

 

Example 1:

Illustration of graph  
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]  
Output: [2,4,5,6]  
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.  
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.  
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.   
Example 2:  

Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]  
Output: [4]   
Explanation:  
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.  
  

Constraints:

n == graph.length  
1 <= n <= 104  
0 <= graph[i].length <= n  
0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1  
graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.  
The graph may contain self-loops.  
The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 104].  

## Approach - 
Terminal nodes are the node which have 0 outgoing edge.  
Just think, how can we find the nodes with zero ougoing edge.  
* What if we reverse each edge i.e. reverse the direction of edge like from u->v to v->u.  
If we do so, all incoming edge become outgoing edge and vice-versa.  
Now, the node with 0 incoming edge is terminal node. So now, we can use topological sort.  
As the propeerty of topological sort, it will cover only those node which will have zero incoming edge i.e. the safe node.  

```
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        // REVERSING THE EDGE
        int size=graph.length;
        List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){ adj.add(new ArrayList<>()); }
        for(int node=0; node<size; node++){
            for(int adjNode : graph[node]){
                adj.get(adjNode).add(node);
            }
        }
        // APPLYING TOPOLOGICAL SORT
        int indegree[]=new int[graph.length];
        for(int node=0; node<adj.size(); node++){
            for(int adjNode : adj.get(node)){
                indegree[adjNode]++;
            }
        }
        Queue<Integer> q= new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<adj.size(); i++){
            if(indegree[i]==0){
                q.add(i);
            }
        }
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int node=q.remove();
            list.add(node);
            for(int adjNode : adj.get(node)){
                indegree[adjNode]--;
                if(indegree[adjNode]==0){
                    q.add(adjNode);
                }
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(list);
        return list;
