## 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph,   
where graph[u]  is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to.  
More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:  

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).  
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).  
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).  
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.  
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and   
a node in set B.  

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.  

 

Example 1:  


Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]  
Output: false  
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.  
Example 2:  
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]   
Output: true  
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.  
   

Constraints:

graph.length == n 
1 <= n <= 100  
0 <= graph[u].length < n  
0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1  
graph[u] does not contain u.  
All the values of graph[u] are unique.  
If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.  

## Approach - 
using DFS, for each unvisited node, chech for all its adjacent, i.e. if all can be separated in two set
```
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int loc[]=new int[graph.length];
        Arrays.fill(loc,-1);
        for(int i=0; i<graph.length; i++){
            // if not visited and it has adjacent node
            if(loc[i]==-1 && graph[i].length>0){
                if(!rec(graph,loc,i,0)){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    private boolean rec(int graph[][], int loc[], int node, int curloc){
        // if node is already in a location and loc no is not equal to curloc
        if(loc[node]!=-1 && loc[node]!=curloc){
            return false;
        }
        // compiler has reached here - it means 
        // 1 -> either curnode is stored yet in any location or
        // 2 ->  curnode is store in the same location for which it was called
        // so avoid recursive call
        if(loc[node]!=-1){
            return true;
        }
        loc[node]=curloc;
        for(int adjNode : graph[node]){
            if( !rec(graph,loc,adjNode,1-curloc)){
                return false;
            }
            //else if(loc[adjNode]!=1-curloc){ return false; }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
