## Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable

Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of n nodes and three types of edges: 

Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.   
Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.  
Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.  
Given an array edges where edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge of type typei between nodes ui and vi, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.

Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.
 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
1 <= edges.length <= min(105, 3 * n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 3
1 <= typei <= 3
1 <= ui < vi <= n
All tuples (typei, ui, vi) are distinct.

### Approach
Use disjoint set to add edge

## Java code
```
public class Disjoint{
    int parent[];
    int rank[];
    int edge; // here edge indicate required number of edge to complete traversal
    Disjoint(int n){
        parent=new int[n+1];
        rank=new int[n+1];
        edge=n-1;
        for(int i=0; i<=n; i++){
            parent[i]=i;
            rank[i]=0;
        }
    }
    public int findParent(int node){
        if(node==parent[node]) return node;
        return parent[node]=findParent(parent[node]);
    }
    public int union(int u, int v){
        int pu=findParent(u);
        int pv=findParent(v);
        if(pu==pv) return 0;  // if both node is already connected then no need to connect and increase edge.
        if(rank[pu]>rank[pv]){
            parent[pv]=pu;
        }else if(rank[pv]>rank[pu]){
            parent[pu]=pv;
        }else{
            rank[pu]++;
            parent[pv]=pu;
        }
        edge--; // since one edge has been added.
        return 1;
    }

}
class Solution {
    public int maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, int[][] edges) {
        Disjoint alice=new Disjoint(n);
        Disjoint bob=new Disjoint(n);
        int edgeReq=0;
        for(int r[] : edges){
            if(r[0]==3){
                // since edge is not added in any of the person then add 1; Bitwise OR is done to avoid 1+1 from both
                edgeReq+= (alice.union(r[1],r[2])) | (bob.union(r[1],r[2]));
            }
        }
        for(int r[] : edges){
            if(r[0]==1){
                edgeReq+=alice.union(r[1],r[2]);
            }else if(r[0]==2){
                edgeReq+=bob.union(r[1],r[2]);
            }
        }
        if(alice.edge==0 && bob.edge==0) return edges.length-edgeReq;
        return -1;
    }
}
