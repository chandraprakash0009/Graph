## Bellman-Ford

Given a weighted and directed graph of v vertices and edges, Find the shortest distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex, src and return a list of integers where the ith integer denotes the distance of the ith node from the source node. If a vertices can't be reach from the s then mark the distance as 10^8.
Note: If there exist a path to a negative weighted cycle from the source node then return {-1}.

Examples:

Input: edges = [[0,1,9]], src = 0  
Output: [0, 9]  
Explanation: Shortest distance of all nodes from source is printed.   

Input: edges = [[0,1,5], [1,0,3], [1,2,-1], [2,0,1]], src = 2  
Output: [1, 6, 0]  
Explanation: For nodes 2 to 0, we can follow the path: 2-0. This has a distance of 1. For nodes 2 to 1, we cam follow the path: 2-0-1, which has a distance of 1+5 = 6,  

Constraints:  
1 ≤ V ≤ 500  
1 ≤ E ≤ V*(V-1)  
-1000 ≤ data of nodes, weight ≤ 1000  
0 ≤ S < V  

## Approach - 
Since we have to find the shortest path in graph that has negative edge weight and that also contains negative cycle . So in this case, we will use Bellman-Ford algorith.
## Note - In bellman-ford algorithm, we will relax all the edge V-1 time.
By relaxing the edge V-1 times, we would have the shortest path from source to all other node. 
In the Vth time, if we found any node such that its value is not infinite and d(u) + edge_weight < d(v),  it means there is a cycle.

class Solution {
    static int[] bellmanFord(int V, int[][] edges, int src) {
        // Write your code here
        int dist[]=new int[V];
        Arrays.fill(dist,(int)(1e8));
        dist[src]=0;
        for(int i=0;i<V-1; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<edges.length; j++){
                int u=edges[j][0];
                int v=edges[j][1];
                int d=edges[j][2];
                if(dist[u]!=(1e8) && dist[u]+d < dist[v]){
                    dist[v]=dist[u]+d;
                }
            }
        }
        for(int j=0; j<edges.length; j++){
            int u=edges[j][0];
            int v=edges[j][1];
            int d=edges[j][2];
            if(dist[u]!=(1e8) && dist[u]+d < dist[v]){
                return new int[]{-1};
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }
}
