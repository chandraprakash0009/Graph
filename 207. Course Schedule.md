## 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:  

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]   
Output: true  
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.   
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.  
Example 2:  

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]  
Output: false  
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.   
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.  
 

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

## Approach - 
Since we have to take all courses and there is some prerequisite for some course such that [u,v] means to take u, we first complete task v. 
So, there is a edge from from v to u i.e.  v->u.
first form a adjacency list to easy detection of adjacent.
We can take all course if there is no cycle in the formed graph.
and we know that if there is concept of cycle in the directed, topological sorting is the best .
Hence, using topological sorting, traverse to each node -
    1.  if all node is visited then we can take all course
    2.  otherwise, we cannot take all courses.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {\
        // forming the directed graph
        List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<numCourses; i++){
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        } 
        
        // applying topological sorting.
        int indegree[]=new int[numCourses];
        for(int i=0; i<prerequisites.length; i++){
            int u=prerequisites[i][1];
            int v=prerequisites[i][0];
            adj.get(u).add(v);
            indegree[v]++;
        }
        Queue<Integer> q= new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<numCourses; i++){
            if(indegree[i]==0){
                q.add(i);
            }
        }
        int count=0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int node=q.remove();
            count++;
            for(int adjnumCoursesode : adj.get(node)){
                indegree[adjnumCoursesode]--;
                if(indegree[adjnumCoursesode]==0){
                    q.add(adjnumCoursesode);
                }
            }
        }
        return count==numCourses;
    }
}
