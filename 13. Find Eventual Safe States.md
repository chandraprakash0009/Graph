## 802. Find Eventual Safe States

There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1.  
The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].
A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

Example 1:  

Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]  
Output: [2,4,5,6] 
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.  
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.  
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.  
Example 2:  

Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]  
Output: [4]  
Explanation:  
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.  

Constraints:

n == graph.length  
1 <= n <= 104  
0 <= graph[i].length <= n  
0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1  
graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.  
The graph may contain self-loops.  
The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 104].  

## Appraoch - 
Since we have to find the nodes from which we can go to terminal node or safe node. if we are at any node and any its adjacent node go to a node which has formed a cycle or 
current path has formeed a cycle then that node would not be safe node. after traversing each adjacent node , it any of its path does not form a cycle then this node would be safe node.

```
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        // cycleNode array would have only safe node
        boolean cycleNode[]=new boolean[graph.length]; Arrays.fill(cycleNode,false);
        // vis array will track the visited array to avoid repeated recursive call
        boolean vis[]=new boolean[graph.length];
        // path array would consist of only those node which is included in the current path
        boolean path[]=new boolean[graph.length];
        for(int i=0; i<graph.length; i++){
            if(!vis[i]){ 
                rec(graph,i,vis,path,cycleNode);
            }
        }
        List<Integer>  list=new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<cycleNode.length; i++){
            if(cycleNode[i]){
                list.add(i);;
            }
            
        }
        return list;
    }
    private boolean rec(int graph[][], int node, boolean vis[], boolean path[],boolean cycleNode[]){
        vis[node]=true;
        path[node]=true;
        for(int adj : graph[node]){
            // chech if any of its adjacent node goes to non-safe node
            if(!vis[adj]){
                boolean a = rec(graph,adj,vis,path,cycleNode);
                if(a){ return true; }
            }else if(path[adj]){
                return true;
            }
        }
        cycleNode[node]=true;
        path[node]=false; return false;
    }
    
}
