## Min Cost to Connect All Points (using PRIMS ALGORITHM)

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].  
The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.  
Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.  

Example 1:  
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]  
Output: 20  
Explanation:   
We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.    
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points. 

Example 2:  
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]  
Output: 18  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= points.length <= 1000  
-106 <= xi, yi <= 106      
All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.  

### Approach 
Since we have to connect all points in such a way that cost of connection is minimum, this appear same as MINIMUM SPANNING TREE.
SO using prims algorithm, find the cost.
Steps - 
1. make a boolean array(used) to track if a points has been connected or not.
2. make a integer array (key) which store the cost of connecting ith node or points. Mark initially as infinity.
3. start from 0th node so mark cost of connecting 0th node as 0.
4. In each pass, we will connect only one node. Since 0th node is already connected so now, we will connect only n-1 node where n is the number of vertex.
5. In each pass, do the following -
     1. find the vertex or points which has not been connected(used) and its connecting cost is minimum.
     2. include that node.
     3. from this point, find all other points which has not been used. Check if connecting these two points costs less than the previous connecting cost. If yes them update the connecting cost.
Add the cost of each connecting node and return.

### Java code 

```
class Solution {
    public int minCostConnectPoints(int[][] nums) {
        int n=nums.length;
        boolean used[]=new boolean[n]; // to check if ith node has been connected or not.
        int key[]=new int[n]; // the cost of connecting ith node.
        Arrays.fill(key,Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        key[0]=0; // start from first node or point.
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
            // find the point which has not been connected and its connecting cost is minimum.
            int min = minKey(key,used);
            // include the point.
            used[min]=true;
            // from this point, find all other points which has not been used and distance between them is less than the current cost of node. Update the connectine cost;
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                int dis=Math.abs(nums[min][0]-nums[j][0]) + Math.abs(nums[min][1]-nums[j][1]);
                // if connecting cost of jth point with min points is less than previous connecting cost then update. 
                if(!used[j] && dis<key[j]){
                    key[j]=dis;
                }
            }
        }
        int cost=0;
        for(int num : key){
            cost+=num;
        }
        return cost;
    }
    private int minKey(int key[], boolean used[]){
        // find the node which has not been used and its connecting cost is minimum.
        int minIndex=-1, min=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0; i<key.length; i++){
            if(!used[i] && key[i]<min){
                min=key[i];
                minIndex=i;
            }
        }
        return minIndex;
    }
}
